# Solving_systems_of_equations

### Using native gaussion elimination this matlab code will solve any n x n matrice
### There is also additional code that will create a Lower and Upper trianngle for those who might want to use PA = LU factorization 
### if the actual solution to system there is also an algorithmn for calculating forward, backward, and magnification error


### The least squares function will give you the least squares solution and the least squares error
